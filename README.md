Hi!

I'm Shuting, and I love building things.

Currently, I am a master's student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/machine-learning-data-science-impacted). I graduated from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn) and was proudly supervised by [Prof. Zhu Teng](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8902/), working on software engineering related to public transportation.

My focus areas include {Backend, Systems for ML and LLM Agents}. This summer, I’ll be joining Meta as an SWE Intern in Seattle. If you’re interested in collaboration or connecting, feel free to reach out -> [shuting dot zhao at outlook dot com]
