Hi!

I'm Shuting, and I love building things.

Currently, I am a master's student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/machine-learning-data-science-impacted). I graduated from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn) and was proudly supervised by [Prof. Zhu Teng](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8902/), working on ML deployment optimization related to public transportation.

This summer I'll join Meta as an SWE Intern in Seattle. Fileds I'm exploring include {AI Agent Systems, Go Microsevices and LLMs}. Always open to connect and collaborate! Reach out via -> [shuting dot zhao at outlook dot com]
