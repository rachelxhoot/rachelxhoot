Hi!

I'm Shuting, and I love building things.

Currently, I am a master's student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/machine-learning-data-science-impacted). I graduated from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn) and was proudly supervised by [Prof. Zhu Teng](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8902/), working on software engineering related to public transportation.

My focus areas include Full-stack, Backend and AI, and I enjoy contributing to open-source community.

I am also seeking 2025 summer SDE internship opportunities in the United States. If youâ€™re interested, feel free to contact me~
